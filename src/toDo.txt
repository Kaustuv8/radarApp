--------> Make the map interactable (zoom in, zoom out, pan). ✅
--------> Make the radar region changeble with mouse click. ✅
            --------> For this, ensure that coordinates can be obtained by just a mouse click.✅
            --------> set the radar such that any region out of bounds is simply not covered.✅
                        ---------> This also includes being able to change the radius of the radar. ✅
--------> Implement and load more tiles that can be explored at once.✅

--------> Make a dual view mode. ✅
            --------> One to show the state borderlayout of India and maybe neighboring regions as an expanded view. ✅
            --------> Another view to show the close up elevation data (already implemented to an extent). ✅

New task and improvements

-> implement MapContent.dispose() method to handle memory leak. ✅
-> download better data to iron out any errors in loading. ✅
-> improve radarLos calculaion so that height of the terrain is added to the height of the added radar. ✅
-> Figure out how to install this on ubuntu.
    -> Install JDK for this version. 
    -> Download the appropriate version of GDAL. 
-> Tidy up the code.
